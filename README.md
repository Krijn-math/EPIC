This repository is associated with the paper "Effective Pairings in Isogeny-based Cryptography" (also known as EPIC).
The algorithms described in this work can be found in the different subfolders of `/src`

This work is in no way production-ready. Instead, it should be treated as a proof-of-concept for using pairings in isogeny-based cryptography,
and may contain bugs and/or typo's.
